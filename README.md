# bostonhouseproject : Predicts the prices of houses using the boston housing dataset from sklearn.

The most difficult part of a machine project is deployment. There is a huge chasm between a trained model & a deploy-ready application.
What we learn in school is to create model-run predictions and that's it. However, when you get into the industry this is where the actual work starts, integrating your model with different services like a web app or an API, scaling it up, and hosting it on a cloud platform.

In my first attempt, I've tried to create and deploy a machine learning model that is based on the boston house pricing dataset from sklearn- that predicts the price of the house based on given features. I've pickled the file for model deployment, used a micro web framework flask - to create my web application, postman API to pull data and heroku for app deployement.
